A simple dice roller app for Pebble watch.  

The buttons perform the following functions:
Select - generates a random number between 1 and the max number
Up - increases the max number by 1 (up to the current limit of 1000)
Down - decreases the max number by 1 (down to the limit of 1)
Long press on select - resets the max number to the default (100)

In the future, I may change the max numbers so that it only allows a limited set of options (4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 20, 100, etc), more closely aligned to the sides on real dice.
